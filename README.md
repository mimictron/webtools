# Personal Website Project

This website was created as part of a class project for a web development course.

## Updates for Final assignment

- created Nav and footer flex boxes

w3School css

- used cyan color scheme for header and footer across all pages on the site
- updated contact us for using input classed (also used for new sign in page)
- added a sign in button to nav (w3 theme, w3 button, w3 round)
- Icon added next to home link in nav (fa fa home)
- nav links hoverable (w3-ul, w3-hoverable)
- updated table on index.html (table, centered, striped, border)
- added an about me page and formatted it with w3 cv template (I removed some of the personal info, wrote a reflection in the top right box where emplyment would go and made the skills, languages, and education somewhat reflect myself. I also fit the template into main so it would match the style of the rest of the site.)

## Reflection

Using W3.CSS can make it a lot easier to get things looking polished without spending forever writing extra CSS. I used it to match the look of my nav and footer on every page, style buttons and lists, and give my table stripes, borders, and centered text. I can see how the full page templates could be especially helpful.
