          My name is Anna Batchelor. I’m currently working towards my second
          bachelor’s degree and looking for ways to build skills that are useful
          beyond the classroom. I’m interested in making a career shift in the
          next year or so and school will help with that. I’m especially focused
          on developing practical, real-world experience that will support
          long-term goals and open up new opportunities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of school and work, I try to stay active and make time for
          creative things when I can. I enjoy being outdoors, the summer
          sunshine and heat is the main reason I moved to Texas. Indoors, I
          spend time playing video games, drawing, and reading. I’m especially
          into narrative-driven games. I share my home with my dog Hatch whose
          always ready for an adventure and my cat Mimic, who prefers to
          supervise from a distance unless there’s food involved. They both
          bring a lot of fun and personality to my routine.

          I signed up for this class because I wanted to rebuild some skills I
          haven’t used in a while. Some time ago, I took a course on building
          websites using the Django framework. It was a good introduction to how
          web apps are structured, but it focused more on backend development
          than front-end design. I’ve also worked a bit with HTML5, CSS, and
          JavaScript, though my experience is limited and it’s been a few years
          since I used any of it regularly.
        </p>
        <p>
          What I’m hoping to get out of this class is a clearer understanding of
          how to build and organize a website from the ground up. I want to
          brush up on the basics, fill in the gaps, and feel more comfortable
          working on simple web projects without needing to rely on templates or
          tutorials for every step.

          I picked Luigi, from the Nintendo franchise Super Mario, as my avatar
          for this class. He’s usually in the background, but he’s still in the
          mix. He’s known for being a little cautious and kind of clumsy at
          times, but he always finds a way through. He’s not the main character,
          but he sticks with it and gets things done.
        </p>
        <p>
          Luigi is Mario’s younger twin, first appearing in 1983 in Nintendo’s
          arcade platformer Mario Bros. In that game he was a green version of
          Mario, but he’s grown into his own character since then. He became the
          main character in the Luigi’s Mansion series, where he hunts ghosts
          with his Poltergust vacuum. He has the ability to jump higher than
          Mario, but he’s slipperier on his feet.
